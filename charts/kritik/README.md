Multi-tenant AI pull request reviewer for GitHub organisations, backed by Postgres and per-review Kubernetes Jobs

**Homepage:** <https://github.com/home-operations/kritik>

## Usage

kritik ships as an OCI Helm chart. It needs a pgvector-enabled Postgres with
three roles, the configuration file, and the secrets the file references:

```sh
helm install kritik oci://ghcr.io/home-operations/charts/kritik \
  --set database.app.existingSecret=kritik-postgres-app \
  --set database.owner.existingSecret=kritik-postgres-credentials \
  --set database.runner.existingSecret=kritik-postgres-runner \
  --values my-values.yaml
```

where `my-values.yaml` carries `config.file` (the declarative configuration:
providers, defaults, tenants with installations and repositories) and
`secretMounts` for the GitHub App keys, webhook secrets and provider API
keys the file references by path. Set `embedding.model` and a key to turn
on the pgvector index and the similar-code context stage.

### Database

kritik separates three Postgres roles and refuses to start otherwise: the
**owner** (runs migrations and applies configuration on the leader, must not
be a superuser), the **application** role (`database.app.role`, must not own
the tables so row-level security applies to it) and the **runner** role
(`database.runner.role`, handed to runner Jobs, can only write its own run).
The `vector` extension must exist before the first start.

On CloudNativePG, the bootstrap owner is `owner`, the other two are declared
under `spec.managed.roles`, and a `Database` resource creates the extension:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: kritik-postgres
spec:
  instances: 1
  imageName: ghcr.io/cloudnative-pg/postgresql:18-standard-trixie
  enableSuperuserAccess: false
  bootstrap:
    initdb:
      database: kritik
      owner: kritik
      secret:
        name: kritik-postgres-credentials
  managed:
    roles:
      - name: kritik_app
        login: true
        passwordSecret:
          name: kritik-postgres-app
      - name: kritik_runner
        login: true
        passwordSecret:
          name: kritik-postgres-runner
---
apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
kind: Database
metadata:
  name: kritik
spec:
  name: kritik
  owner: kritik
  cluster:
    name: kritik-postgres
  extensions:
    - name: vector
      ensure: present
```

Each `passwordSecret` is a basic-auth Secret; kritik reads a `uri` key from
the Secrets named in `database.*.existingSecret`, so either use CNPG's
generated `uri` for the owner or add one for the managed roles (an External
Secrets `Password` generator plus a templated `uri` works).

### Topology

`roles.all` runs everything in one Deployment and is the usual shape. For a
split, disable it and enable `roles.ingest` (webhooks) and `roles.worker`
(queues, runner Jobs, leader duties) with their own replica counts. Any
number of replicas may run; one holds the leader lock at a time.
